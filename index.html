         <p><b><i>Here are some possible goals I hope to achieve in this front-end development course:</i></b></p>
         <p>1. Master HTML and CSS: One major goal would be to understand the fundamentals of HTML (Hypertext Markup
            Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to create the structure and design of web pages.</p>
         <p>2. Build Responsive Websites: I hope to learn how to create responsive web designs that adapt seamlessly to
            various screen sizes and devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and desktops.</p>
         <p>3. JavaScript Proficiency: I would also love to develop a strong foundation in JavaScript to add
            interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.</p>
         <p>4. Learn Front-End Libraries and Frameworks:Another important goal would be to explore popular front-end
            libraries and frameworks like
            React and Angular.</p>
         <p>5. Personal Projects: I also intend to set aside time for personal projects to experiment to apply what I've
            learnt and studied in this course.</p>
         <p>6. Coninuous Learning:I would also like embrace a mindset of continuous learning, as front-end development
            is a field that
            continually evolves with new technologies and best practices.</p>
         <p>7. Contribute to Open Source: I would also Consider contributing to open-source projects to
