   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <div>
      <p>Hello! I'm Mike-kusah Terfa Daniel, and I'm passionate about Music and Software Development. I was born and
         raised in Makurdi, Benue state and have always had a deep curiosity for how Software are being developed and
         what goes on behind the scenes. I am currently studying Computer Science at Veritas University, Abuja where I
         am
         gaining valuable knowledge and skills in Software development and Networking.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, writing music,traveling and playing video games , and I'm
         constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in my field which is why Iâ€™m in HIIT PLC.
      </p>
      <p>I also enjoy Football and my favorite teams are Real Madrid and Newcastle United as their unique styles of play
         dazzles me. My favorite player is Cristiano Ronaldo as his discipline and his hardwork is a key ingredient to
         his success.</p>
